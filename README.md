# JoeCool_Day_Scheduler

## Description

As part of week 5 challenge, I'm tasked with providing a day scheduler that will save user inputs to the local storage and provide certian visual queues based on the time of day througout the day.  

## Installation

No installation is required. This is a web based tool and can be accessed through [JoeCool Password Generator](https://joecool-engineer.github.io/JoeCool_Password_Generator/).

## Usage

Visit the [JoeCool Password Generator](https://joecool-engineer.github.io/JoeCool_Password_Generator/) and click on the **"Save Icon"** once a task/appointment has been entered. This will begin display text at the header to notify user the task/appointment has been saved to the local storage.
